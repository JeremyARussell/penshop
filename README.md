#AnotoWorkshop AKA PenShop

## About

This project was something I made in my spare time to help me create forms for 
something else called NextPen (c). I never sold it so I figured it was about 
time I just released it already.

## Compiling

This project uses Visual Studio, just open up the .sln file and you'll see 
everything there. I'll update the documentation as soon as I get enough time.

## Tasks

[ ] - Build up this here README.md and document the various parts of the codebase.  
[ ] - Refactor things to some standard I've yet to choose.  
[ ] - Explain more about the NextPen, etc.  
[ ] - Update the Github issues with known issues.
